# A-Voice-Controlled-Anti-collision-Robot
We were able to build a responsive system that operated wirelessly through voice commands.  In addition, we successfully interfaced the MAXSONAR to provide collision avoidance.  We were even able to add extra functionality to our design, namely redundancy, servo operation, and successful integration of the accelerometer.
